# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Google Drive Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement Google Drive integration for file discovery and synchronization.
# Details:
1. Use Google Drive API v3 for file operations.
2. Implement file discovery algorithm using pattern matching.
3. Create a Temporal workflow for 15-minute polling and sync.
4. Develop change detection logic to minimize API calls.
5. Implement data extraction from Google Sheets.
6. Create a user interface for Drive connection and file management.
7. Develop a sync status dashboard in the UI.

9. Set up logging and monitoring for sync operations.
10. Optimize for Google Drive API quotas and rate limits.

# Test Strategy:
1. Write unit tests for file discovery and sync logic.
2. Create integration tests using Google Drive API test accounts.
3. Implement end-to-end tests for the complete sync workflow.
4. Perform load testing to ensure scalability of sync operations.
5. Conduct user acceptance testing for the file management interface.
