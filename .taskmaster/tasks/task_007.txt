# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Enhanced Planning Agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop an intelligent Planning Agent to replace the current rule-based distribution system with a data-driven, adaptive approach.
# Details:
1. Remove hardcoded percentage distributions.
2. Implement machine learning model for budget allocation (consider using scikit-learn or TensorFlow).
3. Develop data preprocessing for historical performance data.
4. Create features for CPA, conversion rates, and seasonality.
5. Implement client-specific learning mechanisms.
6. Develop constraint handling for minimum budget requirements.
7. Create an API for the planning agent to receive inputs and return recommendations.
8. Implement continuous learning mechanism to improve recommendations over time.
9. Develop explainability features to understand allocation decisions.
10. Create a fallback mechanism to previous allocation method in case of errors.

# Test Strategy:
1. Develop a test dataset with historical campaign data.
2. Write unit tests for individual allocation functions.
3. Implement integration tests for the complete allocation pipeline.
4. Perform A/B testing against the previous fixed percentage system.
5. Conduct user acceptance testing with sample client data.
