# Task ID: 8
# Title: Create Insights Agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop an Insights Agent to identify patterns, analyze trends, and generate actionable recommendations.
# Details:
1. Implement pattern recognition algorithms (consider using scikit-learn for anomaly detection).
2. Develop trend analysis functions for time-series data.
3. Create anomaly detection system for campaign performance.
4. Implement a recommendation engine based on identified insights.
5. Develop benchmarking system for cross-campaign comparison.
6. Create natural language generation for insight descriptions.
7. Implement prioritization logic for surfacing most important insights.
8. Develop visualization capabilities for trend and pattern representation.
9. Create an API for requesting and receiving insights.
10. Implement caching mechanism for frequently requested insights.

# Test Strategy:
1. Create a diverse test dataset with known patterns and anomalies.
2. Write unit tests for individual insight generation functions.
3. Implement integration tests for the complete insights pipeline.
4. Perform user studies to evaluate the relevance and actionability of insights.
5. Conduct performance testing for large-scale data analysis.
