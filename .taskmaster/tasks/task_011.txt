# Task ID: 11
# Title: Create Unified Data Model
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a unified data model to standardize and aggregate data from multiple platforms.
# Details:
1. Design a flexible schema to accommodate various platform data.
2. Implement cross-platform mapping for campaign structures.
3. Develop metric standardization across platforms.
4. Create aggregation logic for performance data.
5. Implement historical data storage and retrieval.
6. Develop data versioning for change tracking.
7. Create data validation and sanitization processes.
8. Implement efficient indexing for quick data access.
9. Develop API for unified data access.
10. Create documentation for the unified data model.

# Test Strategy:
1. Write unit tests for data mapping and aggregation functions.
2. Implement integration tests with sample data from multiple platforms.
3. Perform data consistency checks across platforms.
4. Conduct performance testing for large dataset operations.
5. Verify data integrity through end-to-end testing.
