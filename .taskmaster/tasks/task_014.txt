# Task ID: 14
# Title: Develop Continuous Learning System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a system for continuous learning and improvement of AI models and recommendations.
# Details:
1. Design feedback collection mechanisms for user actions.
2. Implement model retraining pipelines.
3. Develop A/B testing framework for model improvements.
4. Create performance tracking for model versions.
5. Implement automated feature importance analysis.
6. Develop incremental learning capabilities.
7. Create anomaly detection for model drift.
8. Implement multi-armed bandit algorithms for recommendation improvement.
9. Develop logging and monitoring for the learning system.
10. Create dashboards for tracking model improvements.

# Test Strategy:
1. Implement unit tests for individual learning components.
2. Create integration tests for the complete learning pipeline.
3. Perform simulations with synthetic feedback data.
4. Conduct long-term performance evaluations.
5. Verify model stability and improvement over time.
