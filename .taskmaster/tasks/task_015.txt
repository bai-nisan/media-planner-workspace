# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Feature Flag System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a feature flag system to control the rollout of new capabilities and ensure backward compatibility.
# Details:
1. Choose a feature flag management library (e.g., LaunchDarkly, Optimizely).
2. Implement server-side feature flags in FastAPI.
3. Develop client-side feature flag integration in React.
4. Create a management interface for feature flags.
5. Implement user segmentation for targeted rollouts.
6. Develop analytics for feature usage and performance.
7. Create automated tests for feature flag scenarios.
8. Implement feature flag synchronization across services.
9. Develop rollback mechanisms for problematic features.
10. Create documentation for feature flag usage and best practices.

# Test Strategy:
1. Write unit tests for feature flag logic.
2. Implement integration tests for flag synchronization.
3. Perform end-to-end tests with various flag configurations.
4. Conduct load testing to ensure minimal performance impact.
5. Verify proper function of rollback mechanisms.
