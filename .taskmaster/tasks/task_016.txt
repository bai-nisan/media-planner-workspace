# Task ID: 16
# Title: Enhance Error Handling and Logging
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Improve error handling across the system and implement comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring.
# Details:
1. Implement structured logging using a library like structlog.
2. Develop centralized error handling for FastAPI.
3. Create custom exception classes for specific error scenarios.
4. Implement log aggregation (consider using ELK stack or Datadog).
5. Develop log rotation and retention policies.
6. Create alerting mechanisms for critical errors.
7. Implement context preservation in logs across services.
8. Develop a user-friendly error reporting interface.
9. Create documentation for error codes and troubleshooting.
10. Implement performance logging for key operations.

# Test Strategy:
1. Write unit tests for error handling functions.
2. Implement integration tests for logging across services.
3. Perform chaos testing to verify error handling in various scenarios.
4. Conduct log analysis to ensure all necessary information is captured.
5. Verify alerting mechanisms through simulated error conditions.
