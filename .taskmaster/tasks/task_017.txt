# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 5, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize the performance of the entire system to ensure fast response times and efficient resource usage.
# Details:
1. Implement caching mechanisms (consider using Redis).
2. Optimize database queries and indexing.
3. Implement database connection pooling.
4. Develop asynchronous processing for long-running tasks.
5. Implement pagination for large data sets.
6. Optimize front-end bundle size and loading.
7. Implement lazy loading for components and data.
8. Develop performance monitoring and profiling tools.
9. Optimize image and asset delivery (consider using a CDN).
10. Implement horizontal scaling for key services.

# Test Strategy:
1. Conduct load testing using tools like Locust or JMeter.
2. Perform profiling to identify performance bottlenecks.
3. Implement benchmark tests for key operations.
4. Conduct A/B testing for performance optimizations.
5. Verify performance improvements through continuous monitoring.
