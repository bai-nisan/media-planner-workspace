# Task ID: 19
# Title: Develop Comprehensive Testing Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive testing suite covering unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for the entire system.
# Details:
1. Set up testing frameworks (pytest for backend, Jest for frontend).
2. Implement unit tests for all core functions.
3. Develop integration tests for service interactions.
4. Create end-to-end tests using a tool like Cypress.
5. Implement property-based testing for complex logic.
6. Develop performance tests for critical paths.
7. Create visual regression tests for UI components.
8. Implement contract tests for API endpoints.
9. Develop chaos tests for resilience verification.
10. Create a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing.

# Test Strategy:
1. Aim for high test coverage (>80%) for critical components.
2. Implement test-driven development (TDD) for new features.
3. Conduct regular code reviews with a focus on test quality.
4. Perform mutation testing to verify test effectiveness.
5. Implement continuous testing in the development workflow.
