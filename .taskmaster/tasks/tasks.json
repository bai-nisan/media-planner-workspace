Each command encapsulates a specific request as an object, allowing for parameterization and queueing of requests.\n\nThe Supervisor agent now uses the StateGraph to determine workflow progression and dispatches appropriate commands to coordinate agent activities.

A command factory function (create_command()) has been added to streamline command instantiation.\n\nState management has been enhanced with an AgentState model that extends LangGraph's MessagesState to support multi-agent coordination.
